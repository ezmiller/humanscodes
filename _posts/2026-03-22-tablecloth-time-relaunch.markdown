I recently relaunched the tablecloth.time project. The goal of this project, which remains in an experimental phase, is to explore a composable extension of the popular tablecloth data processing library that aids temporal analysis of tabular data. Relaunching this project required rethinking some of our intial ideas about how this project would work. While the project remains experimental, the new direction aligns with how tablecloth and tech.ml.dataset already work — explicit column arguments, composable operations, no metadata magic.

## Indexing and Optimization

This project started its life several years ago with the SciCloj community. At that time, we thought that the project should be built around a mechanism of setting a temporal index structure on a dataset and then building index-aware functions that could operate over the data efficiently using that index. This was a design philosophy that mimicked the index available in Python Pandas. In Pandas, you might set a time column as your DataFrame's index:

```python
df = df.set_index('Time')
```

Once set, operations like slicing and resampling work implicitly on that index:

```python
df['2024-01']              # all rows from January 2024
df.resample('D').mean()    # daily averages
```

The index is invisible but ever-present — you don't pass the time column to these functions; they just know.

## Rethinking the Need for an Index

At the time the project began, the index seemed necessary both because it was a familiar and convenient tool, and it offered what seemed like necessary optimizations when doing operations that involved subsetting the dataset where using a tree structure offered O(log(n)) optimization.

However, ultimately, neither turned out to be good rationales for an index. Unlike in Python, Clojure's datasets are immutable. They're recreated wholesale each time you transform them. Under these circumstances, the optimization offered by a tree-based index is moot: the constant overhead of needing to build and sometimes rebuild the tree negates the benefit, and a simple binary search on sorted data performs equally well or better.

This insight emerged from a discussion on the Clojurians Zulip in late 2024, after the tech.ml.dataset library removed its indexing mechanism. Chris Nuernberger, the author of dtype-next and the tech.ml.dataset , put it plainly: "You only need tree structures if you are adding values ad-hoc or removing them — usually with datasets we aren't adding/removing rows but rebuilding the index all at once. Just sorting the dataset and using binary search will outperform most/all tree structures in this scenario." Harold, Chris's colleague, validated this with real-world benchmarks: binary search on a million-row dataset performed at over a million rows per second. The simplicity of not needing an index is not a compromise.

There was still, however, the question of whether the index was a useful abstraction for the user. An index allows the user to mark off certain data as the key pivot for analysis, while index-aware functions offer a degree of "magic" allowing the user to simply call a function like `slice` without needing to say what they intend to slice. In R's tsibble package, for example:

```r
vic_elec <- as_tsibble(data, index = Time)
vic_elec |> index_by(Date = as_date(Time)) |> summarise(Demand = mean(Demand))
```

The `index = Time` declaration ripples through everything — `index_by` knows what to group on, plotting functions know the x-axis, and interval detection happens automatically. It's elegant, which makes this approach desirable, but it's also implicit state threaded through your data. So while the the question of optimziation could be answered more definitively, the UX issues involved real choices.

## Favoring Clarity and Composability

That said, within the Clojure data community there was a detectable preference for an approach that offered less magic and greater transparency — clearly represented in @generateme's design of tablecloth's API. In tablecloth, you always say what you mean:

```clojure
(-> ds
    (tc/select-columns [:Time :Demand :Temperature])
    (tc/order-by [:Time])
    (tc/group-by [:Date]))
```

No hidden state, no implicit pivots. Each function takes the data and the columns it operates on. The pipeline reads like what it does. This, of course, is a hallmark of Clojure itself where we prefer to solve complex problems by starting with small pure functions that simply modify immutable data. The beauty of the tech.ml.dataset's objects is that they can be treated the same way.

The software engineer Dan Palmer recently [termed this approach](https://danpalmer.me/2025-06-25-what-is-simplicity/) "flattened simplicity." For Palmer, keeping things simple by not hiding details is one pole on a spectrum — at the other end sits "abstracted simplicity," where details are hidden in favor of high-level concepts. Neither approach is inherently right; in practice we seek to balance the tension between them.

In reviving tablecloth.time, I have been following the flattened pattern. While it might at some point be useful to mark a column as "the time index" and build functions that use that information, for the moment tablecloth.time provides explicit primitives that compose with standard tablecloth operations. You simply say which column you're working with. You see exactly what's being computed.

## Working through a Use Case

We can see this trade-off by working through a concrete case: resampling — aggregating time series data to a coarser resolution.

In Pandas, we see a classic example of abstracted simplicity:

```python
df.resample('D').mean()
```

This is one opaque line. 'D' is a frequency string meaning "daily" — one of dozens of such codes ('W' for weekly, 'M' for monthly, 'H' for hourly, and so on). The operation uses the implicit DateTimeIndex and automatically aggregates every numeric column. Convenient, but what exactly is happening?

Right now tablecloth.time doesn't have a resample function. Instead, resampling is just a pattern — composable primitives that work with standard tablecloth:

```clojure
(-> ds
    (tct/add-time-columns :Time [:day])
    (tc/group-by [:day])
    (tc/aggregate {:Demand #(dfn/mean (% :Demand))}))
```

You choose what temporal component to extract. You specify the time index (`:Time`). You choose what to group by. You choose what to aggregate. Each step is visible, each step composes with the rest of your pipeline. The code reads like what it does — a property Clojure programmers tend to value.

Yet at some point, this pattern could also be packaged, for convience, into a `resample` function that encapsulates this pattern. That would be magic to some degree, but this function would also just name the index: 

```clojure
(-> ds
    (tct/resample :Time :day) ;; returns group-ds 
    (tct/aggregate {:Demand #(dfn/mean (% :Demand))}))
```

Indeed, we could even in this development return to the question of whether it makes sense to mark an index within an expression — perhaps something like `(tct/with-time-index :Time)` that sets metadata for subsequent operations to read. That *would* be implicit state, but set visibly, in the expression that uses it.

The key distinction from Pandas: in tablecloth.time, the index would be pure convenience. The primitives always take explicit column arguments. You could use `with-time-index` if you want, but you could always drop down to:

```clojure
(tct/resample ds :Time :day)
```

The index would be optional sugar, not architecture. That's the difference. Right now, though, I am holding off on building such abstractions. Sticking to the flattened, declarative transformations helps reveal the shape of the patterns that could eventually be wrapped as conveniences.

## What's Available Now

The current release provides a small set of focused primitives. Here's what they look like in action.

### Extracting temporal components

`add-time-columns` extracts fields from a datetime column — day-of-week, month, hour, etc. — as new columns you can group or filter on:

```clojure
(-> vic-elec
    (tct/add-time-columns :Time [:day-of-week])
    (tc/group-by [:day-of-week])
    (tc/aggregate {:Demand #(dfn/mean (:Demand %))}))
```

{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/add-time-columns-example.png" caption="Average electricity demand by day of week — weekends are lower" %}

Weekends clearly have lower demand. The `:day-of-week` field came from `add-time-columns`; the rest is standard tablecloth.

### Slicing time ranges

`slice` selects rows within a time range using binary search on sorted data:

```clojure
(-> vic-elec
    (tct/slice :Time "2012-01-09" "2012-01-15"))
```

{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/slice-example.png" caption="One week of half-hourly demand — daily oscillation visible" %}

Fast even on large datasets. Accepts date strings, datetime literals, or epoch milliseconds.

### Lag and lead columns

`add-lag` shifts column values by a fixed number of rows — useful for autocorrelation analysis. Note this is row-based, not time-aware: you need to know your data's frequency and calculate the offset. Since this dataset has half-hourly readings, a lag of 48 rows equals 24 hours:

```clojure
(-> vic-elec
    (tct/add-lag :Demand 48 :Demand_lag48)
    (plotly/layer-point {:=x :Demand_lag48 :=y :Demand}))
```

{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/add-lag-example.png" caption="Demand vs same time yesterday — strong positive correlation" %}

The tight diagonal shows demand is highly correlated with the same time the previous day — a pattern you'd expect for electricity usage.

These primitives compose with standard tablecloth operations — `group-by`, `aggregate`, `order-by` — to build analysis pipelines. For more worked examples, see the [fpp3 Chapter 2 notebook](https://kingkongbot.github.io/tablecloth.time/chapter_02_time_series_graphics.html).

## What's Next

tablecloth.time is experimental. The API will evolve as patterns emerge from real use. Planned areas include:

- **Rolling windows** — moving averages, rolling statistics
- **Differencing** — for stationarity transformations  
- **Higher-level patterns** — `resample`, `seasonal-decompose` built on the primitives
- **Better integration with tableplot** — time-aware plotting defaults

If you're working with time series in Clojure and want to try it out, feedback is welcome. The [repository is on GitHub](https://github.com/scicloj/tablecloth.time).
